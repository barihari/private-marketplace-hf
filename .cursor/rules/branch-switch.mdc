# Branch Switching

The two branches use different Tailwind versions and need `npm install` each time.

## Commands

**"switch to main"** → run:
```bash
git checkout main && npm install && npm run dev
```

**"switch to upgrade"** (or "switch to ui-upgrade") → run:
```bash
git checkout ui-upgrade && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Why npm install is required
- `main` uses Tailwind v3 (PostCSS + autoprefixer)
- `ui-upgrade` uses Tailwind v4 (@tailwindcss/vite)
- The dep sets are different, so skipping `npm install` will crash the dev server.
